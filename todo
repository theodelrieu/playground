* Support istream&
* remove conan workspaces, create one repo per recipe
* add constraint in binary_to_text::basic_codec (assert iterator value_type is byte_integral)
* rename binary_to_text -> binary_to_base
* use IterableTransformedInputAdapter everywhere except in iterator
* put seek_forward and get as private, friend iterator, change TransformedInputAdapter concept, add those two methods as specific requirements of iterator
* for byte_integral, use std::numeric_limits<>::digits10
