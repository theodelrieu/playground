* Provide FindXXX.cmake for every installable package
* Benchmark!

Later
-----

Fix every usage of T& in meta/concepts (where relevant)

Try again to add an API to optionally get the exact encoded/decoded size.
Useful for sequence containers (string/vector)
Optional InputAdapter API? SizedInputAdapter? Requires a SizedInputTransformer as well.
Then pass the InputAdapter to output_traits::create;

build_require catch2 everywhere

add *_v 

remove every detail from concepts, do everything in one struct 
test every detected with void/void* to look for other GCC bugs
write a custom sfinae friendly iterator_traits
private/public in traits

fix concept comments:

template <typename T>
concept A = B<T> && requires()... use Same where needed

remove build_requirements, investigate Conan local workflow features
put cmake targets in mgs namespace
add a cmake/ folder with reusable content

----- Maybe ----

base58 takes numbers, or string in reverse order...
it would change the Codec concept as well, which only deals with binary to text right now
Rename Codec to BinaryCodec?

Rename InputAdapter to BinaryInputAdapter?
Having a Numeral/Numeric Codec/InputAdapter?

note in doc that only sequence containers are supported
binary_to_text basic_encoder/basic_decoder could be refactored together...

Look again where SFINAE correctness might make sense.


basic_input_adapter -> input_adapter instead of iterable?
use fwd files between iterator and input adapter

add checks on encoding_traits (padding_character && padding_policy == none)

namespace mgs::test_helpers
