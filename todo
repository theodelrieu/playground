Must refine InputAdapter/Transformer requirements, to provide underlying buffer

Try again to add an API to optionally get the exact encoded/decoded size.
Useful for sequence containers (string/vector)
Optional InputAdapter API? SizedInputAdapter? Requires a SizedInputTransformer as well.
Then pass the InputAdapter to output_traits::create;

Refactor basic_codec, with priority tag.
Add encoded_output must be copyable
Might be a good idea to add a basic_codec in binary_to_text to handle '\0' there

usage:
....

build_require catch2 everywhere

----- Maybe ----

base58 takes numbers, or string in reverse order...
it would change the Codec concept as well, which only deals with binary to text right now
Rename Codec to BinaryCodec?

Rename InputAdapter to BinaryInputAdapter?
Having a Numeral/Numeric Codec/InputAdapter?

note in doc that only sequence containers are supported
binary_to_text basic_encoder/basic_decoder could be refactored together...

Look again where SFINAE correctness might make sense.


basic_input_adapter -> input_adapter instead of iterable?
use fwd files between iterator and input adapter

add checks on encoding_traits (padding_character && padding_policy == none)
