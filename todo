Try again to add an API to optionally get the exact encoded/decoded size.
Useful for sequence containers (string/vector)
Optional InputAdapter API? SizedInputAdapter? Requires a SizedInputTransformer as well.
Then pass the InputAdapter to output_traits::create;

usage:

template <typename T>
auto create(InputAdapter<T>);

template <typename T>
auto create(SizedInputAdapter<T>);

build_require catch2 everywhere

remove build_requirements, investigate Conan local workflow features
put cmake targets in mgs namespace
add a cmake/ folder with reusable content

----- Maybe ----

base58 takes numbers, or string in reverse order...
it would change the Codec concept as well, which only deals with binary to text right now
Rename Codec to BinaryCodec?

Rename InputAdapter to BinaryInputAdapter?
Having a Numeral/Numeric Codec/InputAdapter?

note in doc that only sequence containers are supported
binary_to_text basic_encoder/basic_decoder could be refactored together...

Look again where SFINAE correctness might make sense.


basic_input_adapter -> input_adapter instead of iterable?
use fwd files between iterator and input adapter

add checks on encoding_traits (padding_character && padding_policy == none)
