// codecs

mgs::base64
mgs::base64url
mgs::base64url_unpadded

using mgs::base64;

---------------

fix concept comments:

template <typename T>
concept A = B<T> && requires()... use Same where needed

maybe pass encoder/decoder as template template arguments to basic_codec??

does not make sense to have iterators specified in a codec!!

// template template arguments

using mgs::base64;

auto encoder = base64::make_encoder(begin, end);

----- Maybe ----

trigger static asserts for everything??
where to put umbrella headers? mgs/pkg/pkg.hpp

base58 takes numbers, or string in reverse order...
it would change the Codec concept as well, which only deals with binary to text right now
Rename Codec to BinaryCodec?

Rename InputAdapter to BinaryInputAdapter?
Having a Numeral/Numeric Codec/InputAdapter?

UDT: allow more fine-grain control on which codec one can/cannot convert a certain type.
Example, decoding a PrivateKey from base32, when it can only be encoded in base64 is problematic.
