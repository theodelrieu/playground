macros for detected mfun, static mfun etc
move ssize_t to config
use trigger_static_asserts instead of static_assert?

remove input_source requirement on basic_input_range?
take input_source in output_traits::create?
basic_input_range should only be used to wrap an input_source (and the perf are meh so...)
only deal with input_sources?

remove the copyable requirement on input_source?
add make_input_range(input_source)

take read output_iterator by ref? more suited for random_access_iterator, since it does not advance the output iterator...
