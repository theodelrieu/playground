Add encoded_output must be copyable

usage:
....

build_require catch2 everywhere

----- Maybe ----

base58 takes numbers, or string in reverse order...
it would change the Codec concept as well, which only deals with binary to text right now
Rename Codec to BinaryCodec?

Rename InputAdapter to BinaryInputAdapter?
Having a Numeral/Numeric Codec/InputAdapter?

note in doc that only sequence containers are supported
binary_to_text basic_encoder/basic_decoder could be refactored together...

Look again where SFINAE correctness might make sense.


basic_input_adapter -> input_adapter instead of iterable?
use fwd files between iterator and input adapter

add checks on encoding_traits (padding_character && padding_policy == none)
